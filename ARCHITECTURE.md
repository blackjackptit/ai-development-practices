### Architecture Flow Summary

**Request Flow (Top to Bottom):**
1. **Client Layer** → User initiates request
2. **Security Layer** → Authentication, validation, threat detection
3. **Compliance Layer** → Consent check, audit logging
4. **Cost-Aware Layer** → Try free solutions first, then LLM
5. **System Layer** → AI Gateway routes to best provider
6. **Observability Layer** → Log, measure, track cost
7. **Testing Layer** → Validate in all environments

**Cross-Cutting Concerns (Left to Right):**
- **Security**: Perimeter → Gateway → Input → Application → Data
- **Compliance**: Consent → Processing → Storage → Retention → Deletion
- **Observability**: Logs + Metrics + Traces = Full visibility
- **Cost**: Track at every layer, optimize continuously

**Document Mapping:**
- **Blue boxes** = [Security Architecture](SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Green boxes** = [Compliance Architecture](COMPLIANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Yellow boxes** = [Cost-Efficient Architecture](COST_EFFICIENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Purple boxes** = [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Orange boxes** = [Observability Architecture](OBSERVABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md) + [Metrics Guide](METRICS.md)
- **Gray boxes** = [AI Testing Architecture](AI_TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 📊 Architecture Principles

### 1. Cost Efficiency
**Source:** [Cost-Efficient Architecture](COST_EFFICIENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- LLMs are last resort, not first choice
- Deterministic logic → Rules → Cache → LLM
- Use cheapest capable model (Haiku 80%, Sonnet 15%, Opus 5%)
- Aggressive caching (response, semantic, computed)
- Monitor and optimize continuously

### 2. Scalability
**Source:** [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Horizontal scaling with stateless services
- Async processing for long-running tasks
- Message queues for decoupling
- Load balancing across providers
- Auto-scaling based on load

### 3. Reliability
**Source:** [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Multi-provider fallback
- Circuit breakers for fault isolation
- Graceful degradation
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Disaster recovery and backup

### 4. Security
**Source:** [Security Architecture](SECURITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Defense in depth (7 layers)
- Zero trust (verify explicitly, least privilege)
- Multi-layer input validation
- Automated threat detection and response
- Encryption everywhere (at rest, in transit)

### 5. Compliance
**Source:** [Compliance Architecture](COMPLIANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Privacy by design (proactive, not reactive)
- Automated DSR handling (30-day SLA)
- Immutable audit logs (tamper-proof)
- Data lifecycle automation
- Cross-border transfer compliance

### 6. Observability
**Source:** [Observability Architecture](OBSERVABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Three pillars: logs, metrics, traces
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Real-time cost tracking and forecasting
- Actionable alerts with automation
- Low overhead monitoring

### 7. Testing
**Source:** [AI Testing Architecture](AI_TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md)
- Test pyramid: 80% unit, 15% integration, 5% E2E
- Mock by default (real LLM only for E2E)
- Record-and-replay for reproducibility
- Cost tracking in test environments
- Fast feedback loop (<2 min unit tests)

### 8. Measurability
**Source:** [Metrics Guide](METRICS.md)
- Track everything: cost, performance, quality, security
- Define clear thresholds (target, warning, critical)
- Automate metric collection and aggregation
- Build actionable dashboards
- Alert on what matters
