## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Golden Rule
**"LLMs are expensive last-resort tools, not first-choice solutions."**

Before using an LLM, ask: "Can I solve this with code, libraries, or rules?"

### Cost-Aware Pipeline
```
Request → Validation → Rules → Cache → Cheap LLM → Expensive LLM
  FREE      FREE        FREE    CHEAP      $$           $$$$$
```

### Deterministic Logic Examples
| Task | ❌ Expensive (LLM) | ✅ Free (Code) | Savings |
|------|-------------------|----------------|---------|
| Email extraction | $0.001 | $0.00 (regex) | 100% |
| Date parsing | $0.001 | $0.00 (dateutil) | 100% |
| Language detection | $0.001 | $0.00 (langdetect) | 100% |
| Sentiment (clear) | $0.001 | $0.00 (TextBlob) | 70-80% |

Full examples: [Architecture - Section 3](ARCHITECTURE.md#3-deterministic-logic-examples)

### Security Threats
**AI-Specific:**
- Prompt Injection
- Data Leakage
- PII Exposure
- Model Manipulation
- Jailbreaking

**Traditional:**
- SQL Injection
- XSS, CSRF
- API Key Theft
- DDoS

Full threat model: [Security - Section 1](SECURITY.md#1-threat-model-for-ai-applications)

### Compliance Frameworks
- **GDPR** (EU) - Consent, erasure, portability
- **CCPA** (California) - Right to know, delete, opt-out
- **HIPAA** (Healthcare) - PHI protection, BAA
- **COPPA** (Children) - Parental consent
- **PIPEDA** (Canada)
- **LGPD** (Brazil)

## 📖 Best Practices Summary

### Development Workflow
1. **Set up properly** (venv, pre-commit hooks, IDE linters)
2. **Follow Git conventions** (feature branches, meaningful commits)
3. **Test before committing** (unit tests, integration tests)
4. **Keep PRs small** (<400 lines, focused changes)
5. **Deploy to staging first** (verify before production)

### Cost Efficiency
1. **Always try deterministic logic first** (regex, libraries, rules)
2. **Start with cheapest model** (Haiku/GPT-3.5), upgrade only if needed
3. **Cache aggressively** (responses, embeddings, results)
4. **Set max_tokens limits** on all API calls
5. **Limit conversation history** (10-20 messages max)

### Security
1. **Validate all input** (length, format, patterns)
2. **Detect prompt injection** (9+ attack patterns)
3. **Redact PII** before processing (email, phone, SSN)
4. **Store API keys securely** (secret managers, not code)
5. **Implement rate limiting** (per user, per tier)

### Security Architecture
1. **Defense in depth** (multiple security layers)
2. **Zero trust** (verify explicitly, least privilege)
3. **Automate response** (contain threats quickly)
4. **Monitor threats** (anomaly detection, IDS)
5. **Encrypt everything** (at rest, in transit)

### Observability
1. **Track all costs** (per request, endpoint, user)
2. **Log with structure** (JSON format, request IDs)
3. **Monitor latency** (p50/p95/p99, not just average)
4. **Set up alerts** (cost 80%, latency >5s, errors >5%)
5. **Review weekly** (top expensive endpoints)

### Compliance
1. **Get explicit consent** (freely given, specific, informed)
2. **Enable data access** (1-month response time)
3. **Implement deletion** (right to erasure/be forgotten)
4. **Document processing** (purposes, recipients, retention)
5. **Sign DPAs** (with all data processors)

### Compliance Architecture
1. **Privacy by design** (proactive, not reactive)
2. **Automate DSR** (30-day SLA compliance)
3. **Immutable audit logs** (tamper-proof, 7-year retention)
4. **Data lifecycle automation** (retention, deletion, anonymization)
5. **Data residency** (GDPR-compliant transfers)

### Testing
1. **Mock LLM in unit tests** (fast, deterministic)
2. **Test with real APIs** (integration tests only)
3. **Validate prompts** (injection detection)
4. **Measure performance** (latency, tokens, cost)
5. **Run CI/CD** (automated tests on every PR)

### Testing Architecture
1. **Layer tests properly** (80% unit, 15% integration, 5% E2E)
2. **Mock by default** (real LLM only for E2E)
3. **Track test costs** (stay within budget)
4. **Isolate test environments** (independent, repeatable)
5. **Fast feedback loop** (unit tests < 2 min)

### Observability Architecture
1. **Measure everything** (cost, performance, quality, security)
2. **Correlate signals** (request ID across logs/metrics/traces)
3. **Actionable alerts** (clear thresholds, automated response)
4. **Track costs real-time** (per user, per model, forecasting)
5. **Low overhead** (sampling, async, batching)
