# AI Development Policies

A complete collection of practical policies, rules, and best practices for developing AI applications efficiently, cost-effectively, securely, and compliantly.

**📖 [Complete Index & Navigation →](INDEX.md)**

## Overview

14,952 lines of comprehensive policies across 12 documents covering architecture, development workflow, testing infrastructure, observability architecture, cost optimization, monitoring, security, compliance, integration, and testing.

## Documents

### Architecture

  - [Cost-Efficient Architecture](COST_EFFICIENT_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Layered decision architecture, deterministic logic, cost optimization patterns
  - [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) - System integration, microservices, AI Gateway, scalability, and HA patterns

### Development Workflow
- **[AI Development Guide](AI_DEVELOPMENT.md)** - Complete development lifecycle: environment setup, Git workflow, testing, deployment, team collaboration, and best practices

### Cost Management
- **[Cost Reduction Rules](COST_REDUCTION_RULES.md)** - Comprehensive guidelines for minimizing AI development costs while maintaining quality

### Observability
- **[Observability Guide](OBSERVABILITY.md)** - Complete monitoring, logging, metrics, and alerting strategies for AI applications
- **[Observability Architecture](OBSERVABILITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Observability infrastructure and architecture: logging pipelines, metrics collection, distributed tracing, cost tracking, alerting systems, and dashboard design

### Security
- **[Security Guide](SECURITY.md)** - Comprehensive security practices including input validation, prompt injection prevention, PII protection, and incident response

### Compliance
- **[Compliance Guide](COMPLIANCE.md)** - Regulatory compliance including GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, consent management, and data protection requirements

### Integration
- **[Integration Guide](INTEGRATION.md)** - Practical integration patterns and code examples: APIs, SDKs, webhooks, caching, batch processing, and client libraries

### Testing
- **[Testing Guide](TESTING.md)** - Comprehensive testing strategies for AI applications: unit tests, integration tests, prompt testing, model evaluation, and CI/CD
- **[AI Testing Architecture](AI_TESTING_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Testing infrastructure and architecture: mock servers, test data management, CI/CD pipelines, A/B testing framework, and testing observability

## Quick Start

### Key Principles

1. **Use the smallest capable model** - Start with Haiku/GPT-3.5, upgrade only when necessary
2. **Optimize tokens** - Keep prompts concise, set max_tokens limits
3. **Cache aggressively** - Cache responses, embeddings, and intermediate results
4. **Monitor continuously** - Track token usage and costs per endpoint
5. **Test cheaply** - Mock responses in tests, use cheap models for development

### Implementation Checklist

**Cost Optimization:**
- [ ] Review [Cost Reduction Rules](COST_REDUCTION_RULES.md)
- [ ] Implement response caching
- [ ] Use deterministic logic where possible (regex, libraries, rules)
- [ ] Set max_tokens on all API calls
- [ ] Add rate limiting per user/tier
- [ ] Limit conversation history

**Observability:**
- [ ] Set up structured logging (JSON format)
- [ ] Track token usage and costs per request
- [ ] Configure budget alerts (80%, 95%, 100%)
- [ ] Create cost/performance dashboards
- [ ] Monitor cache hit rates
- [ ] Set up error rate alerts
